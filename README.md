GymBuddy app provides workout recommendations to the gym member based on their personal preferences detailed in the user profile as well as equipment availability. There are many different apps that are available on the App Store and Google Play Store that provide the user with very general fitness guides and tips. However, there is nothing currently available that is tailored to what equipment a gym has and what workout routines can be performed based on what equipment is currently available. Implementing a system that can provide the aforementioned services to a gym member would be very useful to both gym members and the gyms itself.
